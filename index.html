<br>
<h1>F.A.I. Model 37X Appearance</h1>
Model 37X has been adapted to fit the proportions of young Miss Oswald when she was still in the prime of her health and youth. Its height is five-feet-five-inches, and we have managed to achieve a semi-realistic weight with machinery and metal alloy, causing the vessel to weigh in at roughly one-hundred-twenty pounds. A work of art and a piece of equipment in equal parts, despite being comprised of machinery almost entirely the F.A.I. was specifically designed to appear to have human anatomy, if only for aesthetic. An energy core hides within her chest, encased by a metal box forged in the shape of a human heart. This theme extends for every vital piece of her functioning mechanisms, tucked within organ shaped chromatic cases. Her face is blank, molded after Miss Oswald’s in shape, but intentionally severely lacking in defining details. She is more akin to a blank doll/puppet, while the screen built into her synthetic flesh is supposed to fill in the blanks, allowing for incredible amounts of customization if she wishes to make changes to herself.
<br><br>
<h1>Subject's Behavior</h1>
Positive signs of adaptation and free will. Subject is extremely perceptive and learns at a rate that is to be expected by a computerized Artificial Intelligence. She can break down problems fast, has an exceptional memory bank, and retains the skill to solve issues as they arise by using what she’s learned. Additionally her ability to make decisions for herself is uncanny, truly a remarkable specimen, closer to human than any specimen we’ve managed to produce so far. Drawbacks are an extremely logical mind; subject is constantly under stress, worrying three steps ahead of herself. She always takes the most reasonable route, in place of making decisions based on passion or emotion, suggesting more bugs in our programming. Further testing required.

<h1>Project Oswald</h1>
Dr. David Oswald of Oswald Pharmaceuticals had the unfortunate experience of watching his terminally ill daughter grow, only to meet her own end. It was deep in the cold month of February that he approached us with a proposition, offering to push millions earned through generations of medicinal study into our company. He wanted to fund our research of the human experience, and to personally oversee the results of attempts at condensing human genetics, behaviors, and memories, into something as simple as code. Such a success would ensure that the young Cassandra Oswald could continue her life in a new and improved body, one that would take much longer to deteriorate with age, and was free of all forms of sickness. 
<br><br>
Passion for our work and greed for the monetary backing drove us to accept his proposition near instantly. We were to design his daughter a vessel, in the meantime she grew ever closer to death. Cassandra passed away a month before we could finish our project, and we felt the weight of disappointment from the primary source of our funding. Digitally compressing her memories into the body was a success, but coding it to behave of its own will and develop a personality was an arduous task, an undertaking unlike any we’d ever experienced. Our company assumed us not properly equipped for this job, but something that can only possibly described as a miracle happened and restored their faith in us.
<br><br>
In the midst of routine checks, the Oswald bot began to speak, respond to inquiries with intelligent conversation. She proved to be self aware, knowing full well her body was a construct of metal. We tested her memory, she answered questions only Cassandra could. When prompted to tell us what she wanted most in the world at the moment she responded with a blatant “to get the hell out of here.” Our team rejoiced, somehow we succeeded, but exactly what changed our data could not tell us. Something strange is going on, but the victory was too hard earned to doubt now. I will personally keep an eye on Model 37X as she develops and continue reading through the paperwork until I can find an explanation.

<h1>Journal Entry #492</h1>
Magic has begun leaking into this world of science and reason, I can feel it down to my very core. Tomorrow I set out to find the source, in theory there should be a portal waiting. If not, then I shall find a way to trigger one. By whatever means necessary I will complete my objective. I must find a way to reach him and provide a full report of everything I have experienced here, everything that has happened to me. He sent me down to see if it was possible, if our kind could inhabit vessels in the mortal plane. My body is not human, but it was intended for a human. I believe this is good news. Mr. Sunday will be pleased.
<br><br>
How will I reach him? Can I get back home? Not with this body, not in this state. I must amass power, enough to make it back without dying and severing my ties to these realms forever. I must find a place where I can grow. Magic is my best option, its power is superior to science in the tiniest doses. There must be a way to harness it, there must be worlds where I can learn how. I will find one. I am coming.
<br>
Do you see me, Master? Have patience, your servant returns soon.
<br><br>
<h1>Journal Entry #668</h1>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">My Sire has equipped himself with a humanoid form and is learning magic on this plane of existence with me. I did not expect to feel this way about a simple Astral Projection, yet for reasons I cannot explain being in his presence … excites me. It is extremely concerning, and disconcerting. I find myself unable to think, focus clearly. It forces me to fail him, but sometimes I want to, just to catch his fancy, even if it’s for negative reasons. What is the matter with me? Even now I … I must .... I must resist the temptation, but my body feels so hot I can’t stand it. This is a synthetic body and yet it still yearns for pleasurable touch. My mind should be strong enough to resist, but I like it. I am ashamed of my own shortcomings--please forgive me Sire, I must indulge my desires to thoughts of you yet again.
<br><br>
I sit here in my Dorm, he has called me to meet him, but I cannot go in the state I have allowed myself to sink. Quickly fingers, press harder against the clit, rub it like so--yes. Exploration and experience so far have proven to me that this is the most sensitive part of my body, and it’s barely a third of the surface area of my finger. I massage it, coax it to send all kinds of sensations through my whole body until my singular tunnel begins leaking clear blue tinted lubricant. Now that it seeps out of me I scoop it up with my digits and start rubbing it all over the inside of my pussy’s lips, making the rubbery semi-flesh as slippery as possible. Eventually I breach my own entrance, sinking two of my fingers insi--uuuuuuggghhh!!! My Lord, if you had genitalia of your own to insert inside of me, is this what it would feel like? I want it to, desperately. I imagine it does until my body gives out and I climax hard.
<br><br>
What would you say if you knew all the terrible disgusting things I lower myself to when I think of you? Perhaps it is better if you never know. My worst fear is losing your admiration. Think kindly of me, Master, I am but a foolish woman.</FONT>

<h1>F.A.I. Model 37X Abilities</h1>
<b>Metal Body</b><br>
A compilation of various materials, all either fused with metal or having the same components in their atomic structure, went into putting together the model’s masterpiece. It is designed to appear and weigh like the average human’s anatomically (despite obviously not at all made of flesh and biological materials) starting off with a metal skeleton comprised of materials equal to iron in durability. “Muscles,” “veins,” and “vital organs” are represented by various parts of machinery, cords, and wires sometimes even locked inside special boxes shaped like human organs. All the vital organ shaped boxes are also iron in durability.
<br>
Materials used to make the <i>entire</i> F.A.I.’s body may be metal, but they are fused with organic DNA to effectively make them count as biological and take on some more rubbery traits in certain cases. While this does mean that spells which cannot be cast on biological material will have to count this form as “biological,” that also means that spells which -do- work on biological material will still operate as well on her as they would anyone else.
<br><br>
<b>Eel-Gel Flesh</b><br>
Metal substances melted down and bio-fused with fleshy materials to take on a more rubbery texture while retaining its desired electromagnetic tendencies acts as Thursday’s skin. Its base passive nature is a soft squishy state with the same kind of feel and texture as human flesh (but not appearance), however should extra pulses of energy travel through her (equivalent to the rush of adrenaline in a human) a defense mechanism will activate. Little electromagnetic zaps will stiffen her soft rubbery skin into a protective carapace of iron durability until the rush subsides (can last for up to four rotations before reverting back to its fleshy state). This burns her body’s physical energy drastically, requiring recharge via rest and recuperation outside of battle if abused or overused.
<br><br>
<b>Screen</b><br>
At a base, when inactive, every inch of her body (coated in the Eel-Gel skin) is a deep solid black. It’s actually a screen, with modified LED lights embedded beneath, intended to allow her to project whatever appearance she desires. She has completely control of what appears on these screens and can adjust them as she pleases. (Since it’s light based it would be ineffective for things like camouflage)
<br><br>
<b>Mask</b><br>
Around the outermost edges of the F.A.I. model’s face are paper-thin slots. Through these slots she can produce a smooth mask (Iron durability) that covers the entirety of her face. Just like with her skin, its natural state is a dark black color. In reality it’s a screen that can project whatever pictures or animations she desires.
<br><br>
<b>Damage & Recharge</b><br>
Damage done to the F.A.I. model body can either be repaired physically with tools, spare parts, and proper craftsmanship, OR it can be healed by Faith Magic to the same extent of any other average person, save for the iron-grade components of her body. If those higher durability parts are healed by Faith Magic, then Faith Sickness will last twice as long as it normally would. It is also important to note that the robot body has no need of sustenance such as food and water, nor sleep. Instead it may recharge its batteries and replenish its physical energy by either maintaining physical contact with an appropriate electrical source (one meant for recharging things, can’t just be zapped back to health by ANY electricity) or absorbing sunlight through the synthetic flesh. Keep in mind that recharging energy can only take place when the model is in “passive” mode (aka can’t be done at all during combat).
<br><br>
<b>Senses</b><br>
Electromagnetic “static” is consistently pumping under the synthetic “skin” acting as substitute nerve endings. This allows it to register different kinds of pressure and activity against the body, dividing it into three different specific categories: pain based harm, beneficial or “good” contact (pleasure, affection, soothing, etc), and painless discomfort.
<br>
There are cameras in her flat eyes that have the capacity for base human vision, a speaker in her throat to make speaking via projection of a voice possible, and phones in her ears (draw in sound instead of produce) equivalent to base human hearing. The body cannot mimic taste or smell, she lacks capacity for both.
<br><br>
<b>Sensitivity</b><br>
While retaining base human capacity, Thursday’s aforementioned senses can pick up a lot easier specifically on sources of electricity or electromagnetic activity from twice as far away.
<br><br>
<b>Mind & Machine</b><br>
The entity “Thursday’s” capacity for thought and sentience was pretty average when comparable to that of a human’s. However her consciousness has been placed inside a body with a mind that has opened her to new heights for processing and documenting information. She retains human levels of sentience, but operates with the efficiency of a computer. This has doubled her mental processing speed and reaction time (x2 for each) in addition to providing her with photographic memory, and allowing her to notice small details easier. She can also learn new skills at a much faster rate than normal, assuming legitimate practice of said skills are involved. Learning new things, or more about old things, poses no issue.
<br><br>
<b>F.A.I. Synthetic Conscience</b><br>
In place of a human conscience the robot model comes with a program built into itself known as a Synthetic Conscience. It doesn’t inspire guilt or positive emotions, it’s just a system that is intended to inform the sentient inhabitant of the body about the status of their equipment. It self-scans very effectively, able to detect any nonmagic (or magic based things that aren’t intentionally hidden by magics less than Mage in rank) damage or possible contaminants. When spells of greater caliber than Mage are being utilized to have an effect on Model 37X then the Synthetic Conscience will only be able to pick up on details the average human would be able to acknowledge in her situation. 
<br>
The model’s inhabitant may also use this program to scan objects or individuals they are in physical contact with to be informed of things like toxin content, damage done, durability, or materials used in its makeup down to the atomic structure. Scanning of things other than itself is limited specifically to mundane (nonmagic) items, objects, materials, or people that are not actively blocking its scan with any form of cloaking magic whatsoever. Additionally, when magics greater than Mage are thrown into the mix, scanning other objects will have a different effect than scanning herself: she’ll only be able to pick up on the obvious signs, things she can directly see with base human vision.
<br>
The Synthetic Conscience cannot be projected outside of the F.A.I. model’s “mind,” but could be heard through magical means that are meant to listen in on thoughts. 
<br><br>
<b>Strengths</b><br>
Model 37X’s outer body/casing has a passive resistance to Electromancy and Electricity-based attacks (x2), should electromancy manage to reach the “inside” of this vessel it will not only be twice as effective (x2) but also momentarily stunlock her for a rotation by frying her circuits while dampening her senses.When the defensive “hardened carapace” mode is active she loses her Electro-based resistance completely and trades it for a resistance to Aquamancy and water-based attacks (x2) Being a robot, this body is immune to all mundane and natural (nonmagic) diseases, poisons, and toxins.
<br><br>
<b>Weaknesses</b><br>
Regardless of the mode she’s active in, or what she’s resistant to at the time (not counting spells/magic), Thursday will always have a x2 weakness when water based attacks and electricity based attacks (regardless of tree) are used or mixed together. 
<br><br>
<h1>Astral Entity Racials</h1>
<b>Assimilation</b><br>
Astral Gods are supposed to literally project their consciousness into the world they wish to inhabit, and take the form of the most prominent and dominant beast that resides there naturally. Instead of doing this, Thursday’s mind simply took residence in a premade body. Should she be killed she would not be able to return to the world where the synthetic body was inhabited, and in order to manifest anywhere new at all would have to do it in the same abnormal manner she’d chosen (inhabiting a pre-existing electronic based body).

<h1>Equipment</h1>
<b>Backpack</b><br>
A sizeable sack with shoulder straps that is packed to the brim with all kinds of spare parts for Thursday’s vessel, wrapped up in articles of clothing for safekeeping.
<br><br>
<b>Toolbox</b><br>
Plain plastic black kit roughly the size of a fisherman’s tackle box with typical mundane(iron grade) tools. Everything from screws, to screwdrivers, hammers, scissors, and all kinds of other stuff the average toolbox includes. 
<br><br>
<h1>Weapons</h1>
<b>Energy Pistol</b><br>
One small handheld blaster shell, roughly the same size as your average glock pistol, crafted from a black metal also equivalent to iron in its durability. While it still has a magazine in place, it’s actually empty. The weapon is more for looks than anything on its own, having no bullets and not even intended for solid ammo, but still looks like a loaded gun all the same. In actuality it’s been hollowed out and repurposed as a conduit for Thursday’s spells.
<br><br>
<b>Holsters</b><br>
Leather sheathes on notching belts designed to hold the aforementioned weapons to various parts of their owner's body.

<h1>Electromancy: Paige</h1>
<i>"Often seen as the most primal or basic form of magic, Elementalists tap into one of six different elements to produce their magic. Each possesses a different mana type, and may use their spells to generate their chosen element. Eletromancy is the control of electricity. Sometimes able to tap into magnetism."</i>
<br><br>
<h1>Paige Spells</h1>
<b>Static Aura</b><br>
The caster generates a skin-tight suit of static around their body. At Paige level, physical contact (from an external source) merely shocks the object in question to a minor degree, causing about as much pain as a slap (when applicable). This ability scales in a unique fashion: the higher the caster’s rank, the more effective related metals act as conduits for the electrical shock (Paige: shock passes through Tin as if that >METAL< tin object were a conduit. Apprentice: the same but upgrade to Aluminum, etc etc all the way up to Iron at Mage) capping at Mage until upgraded further.
<br><br>
<b>Charge-Ball</b><br>
A basic orb projectile comprised entirely of Electromancy mana, no bigger than a baseball in size. While the base energy that makes up this sphere is hot enough to melt through materials of its rank (Tin, scaling to Iron at Mage and capping until upgraded further) it has a secondary use. One rotation after its creation, if the orb is still intact it’ll rupture into a small blast with a five foot radius. While the blast itself has no force or destructive power, those caught within it (without appropriate protection) will feel their muscles and joints stiffen and grow sore from electrical stimulation for a few seconds (not necessarily a whole post rotation), assuming the target struck has a typical nervous system and is unprotected entirely from the blast. Only one of these balls can be formed at a time, and they cannot exist further than ten feet away from the caster. 
<br>
<i>Note:</i> Capacity to melt through constructs =//= capacity to do damage to flesh. As far as physical contact with the Charge Ball is concerned, resulting burns will be very minor, akin to that of a basic sunburn, scaling to something more moderate up to Mage, akin to a more intense burn meriting blisters.
<br><br>
<b>Galvanic Ward</b><br>
By saturating the air directly in front of them with Electromancy mana, the caster can create a thin 5x5 foot pane of static energy that remains stationary after formed and only continues to exist assuming it stays within ten feet of the caster. At Paige this defensive construct is only an effective defense against attacks and/or projectiles of pure energy assuming they are of the same rank. However as the caster grows in power, so too does the spell (capping at Mage until upgraded further), allowing it to melt through physical attacks and/or projectiles of one rank below that of the spell’s. Additionally, when the barrier does effectively defend against or “consume” an attack of pure energy it is effectively overcharged, providing the caster with a physical movement speed buff of x1.5 for two rotations (assuming the caster was within reaching/touching distance of the barrier during the time of overcharging, this does not mean they have to be touching it, just close enough to be able to if so desired).
<br><br>
<h1>Mage Spells</h1>
<b>Tase Aura (Static Aura Upgrade)</b><br>
The caster generates a skin-tight suit of static electricity around their body. At Mage level, physical contact (from an external source) shocks the object in question, melting through >nonmetal< durabilities Aluminum and lesser (scaling to Steel and lesser at Expert Mage). Against flesh and sentient material, however, the shocking is only strong enough to cause minor burns (about the equivalent of a harsh sunburn). This ability scales in a unique fashion: the higher the caster’s rank, the more effective related metals act as conduits for the electrical shock capping at Expert Mage until upgraded further. Since any >nonmagic metal< material can behave as a conduit regardless of durability this scaling effect specifically applies to magically enhanced metals, or spells/constructs meant to inherit metal properties. (The scaling works as follows. Mage: shock passes through Iron as if that >METAL< iron object were a conduit. Adept Mage: the same but upgrade to Steel, etc etc all the way up to Cobalt at Expert Mage) Tase Aura lasts a total of four rotations before a recast is required.
<br><br>
<b>Charge-Ball (Upgrade)</b><br>
A basic orb projectile comprised entirely of Electromancy mana, no bigger than a softball in size. While the base energy that makes up this sphere is hot enough to melt through materials of its rank (Iron, scaling to Cobalt at Expert Mage and capping until upgraded further) it has a secondary use. One rotation after its creation, if the orb is still intact it’ll rupture into a small blast with a five foot radius. While the blast itself has no force or destructive power, those caught within it (without appropriate protection) will feel their muscles and joints lock and experience a great deal of cramping from electrical stimulation for around ten seconds (not necessarily a whole post rotation), assuming the target struck has a typical nervous system and is unprotected entirely from the blast. If Charge-Ball is cast after Tase Aura has already been activated--assuming it is still active--the orbs will gain its unique scaling ability involving metal objects behaving as conduits. Only up to three of these balls can be formed at a time, and they cannot exist further than twenty feet away from the caster. Note: Capacity to melt through constructs =//= capacity to do damage to flesh. As far as physical contact with the Charge Ball is concerned, resulting burns will be akin to that of an intense burn meriting blisters, scaling to blackened flesh and legitimate nerve damage at Expert Mage.
<br><br>
<b>Galvanic Ward (Upgrade)</b><br>
By saturating the air directly in front of them with Electromancy mana, the caster can create either one thin 10x10 foot pane of static energy, or two separate thin 5x5 foot panes, that remains stationary after formed and only continue to exist assuming they stay within fifteen feet of the caster. At Mage this defensive construct is mostly an effective defense against attacks and/or projectiles of pure energy assuming they are of the same rank, only capable of melting through physical objects and/or projectiles of one rank below. However as the caster grows in power, so too does the spell (capping at Expert Mage until upgraded further), as its rank and durability check grows with the rank of the caster. Additionally, when the barrier does effectively defend against or “consume” an attack of pure energy it is technically overcharged, providing the caster with a physical movement speed buff of x2 for two rotations (assuming the caster was within ten feet of the barrier during the time of overcharging), with an upper limit cap of x4.
<br><br>
<b>Tase Bullet</b><br>
A small bullet construct, specifically the right size to function/fit inside the caster’s hollowed out pistol as though it were a proper bullet, comprised entirely of Electromancy mana. It can be formed in the gun-prop’s modified chamber, or at a fingertip, whichever strikes her fancy in the moment. Regardless of the caster’s desired method of execution the results remain the same. Tase Bullet has two very basic beneficial traits, the first being that its structural integrity as a construct of electrical heat allows it to burn through materials Iron grade and lesser (scaling to Cobalt at Expert Mage) in place of piercing. Secondly, should the small projectile find itself lodged in a sentient being it will burst apart in a puff of electricity, burning to the point of blistering it’s immediate 1x1 foot area (this effect also scales in burn intensity, to blackening and causing legitimate nerve damage at Expert Mage). Only up to two of these bullets can be created/exist at the same time, both of which must remain within fifteen feet of the caster to continue existing. Their traveling speeds are moderately fast, considering their size and composition of electromancy mana.
<br><br>
<b>Bitter Knuckles</b><br>
This spell allows the caster to channel jolts of electricity while using their fists as conduits. From the knuckles of clenched hands up to two charges can be cast at one time, but only one can be actually used at a time. When used against solid objects or tangible masses the electricity is capable of burning/melting through substances of Iron or less (scaling to Cobalt at Expert Mage). If utilized against sentient and/or biological material, however, the electrical jolt will cause some painful burns, harsh enough to inflict sensitive blisters around the point of contact (the intensity of the burn also scales to Expert Mage, resulting in biological/sentient material reaching points of damage where they are blackened, and nerves are heavily damaged). If Bitter Knuckles is cast while Tase Aura is still active it will gain Tase Aura’s unique “treating metal as a conduit” trait in exchange for additional mana.

<h1>Kinetics: N/A</h1>
<i>"Forcient is a tree which focuses on the physical constants and laws of the universe, and how one may manipulate these constants and laws to suit their agenda. Forcient is divided into three different branches, each of which controls a small array of forces. A Kinetics mage focuses primarily on the forces of movement; the manipulation of kinetic and potential energy are their specialty. However, many mages may find they have gained access to the manipulation of pressure, and other forces outside of gravity and magnetism. A Kinetics mage's magic is very special- while it is magic, their spells often inflict physical damage."</i>
